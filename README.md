This repository contains a simple interactive UI program for a [SenseCAP Indicator Device](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Sensor/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/Get_started_with_SenseCAP_Indicator/). It was programmed for an Embedded Systems project at Defang Software Labs.

The device has a square liquid-crystal touch screen display, and a ESP32-S3 chip that can be programmed in an Arduino environment.

This version of the program was created using [Squareline Studio](https://squareline.io/), a UI design tool for embedded devices.  It includes an interactive demo of the touch screen, and handles touch screen user input. There is no wifi networking involved.
