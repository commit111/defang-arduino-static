# Interactive UI for Embedded Systems Project at Defang Software Labs (Static)
*Note: This version of the repository is named **"static"** as there is no wifi networking involved.*

*For the networking version of this project, see the `/defang-arduino` repository.*

This repository contains a simple interactive UI program for a [SenseCAP Indicator Device](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Sensor/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/Get_started_with_SenseCAP_Indicator/). It was programmed for an Embedded Systems project at Defang Software Labs.

This version was created using [Squareline Studio](https://squareline.io/), a UI design tool for embedded devices.  It includes interactive demo screens, and handles touch screen user input. There is no wifi networking involved.
